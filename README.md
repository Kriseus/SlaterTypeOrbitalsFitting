The main aim of the project is to use Slater type orbitals to make a model that finds best values of exponential and normalization parameters that fit to optical parameters P_0, P'_0 and Q0 of semiconductor III-V materials. Found by the model values 
give us a information about orbitals inside the crystal lattice and Bloch Function. 

In the project there are 6 files. One with abstract class of parameter which has methods and values that ale the parameters have. File with parameters P_0, P'0, Q_0, that Calculates values of those parmeters. Theres are also files 
with numerical(calculating integrals, Derivatives and mod_squeres) and wavefunction(calculating spherical harmonics, radial parts and Slater type orbitals) methods. The last file is fitting file which fits our model parameters to optical parameters of 
III-V materials. 

Similar(but not 100% same) conception (which was base for my conception) was presented in this article:
